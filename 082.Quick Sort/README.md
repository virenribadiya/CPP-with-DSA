Like Merge Sort, QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways. 

- Always pick the first element as a pivot.
- Always pick the last element as a pivot (implemented below)
- Pick a random element as a pivot.
- Pick median as the pivot.
