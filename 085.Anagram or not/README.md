## What are Anagram Strings ?
Two strings will be anagram to each other if and only if they contains the same number of characters.

Note - Order of the characters doesn't matter.

If two strings are anagram, then one string can be rearranged to form the other one. For Example:

abc and cba are anagram.
creative and reactive are also anagram
